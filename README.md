# BraTPRO-challenge
Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Random Forest Model to Predict Glioblastoma RANO Progression Response. The Random Forest model takes a radiomics approach, extracting relevant quantitative features from tumour regions and predicting RANO response accordingly.

Model was submitted to the BraTPRO Challenge for the MICCAI2024 Conference.
